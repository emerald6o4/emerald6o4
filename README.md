# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=emerald6o4)
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm [@emerald6o4], a passionate programmer with a deep love for Lua. Lua is a lightweight, versatile, and powerful scripting language that has captured my heart and become an integral part of my coding journey. But not Roblox's Lua, "Luau"

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently exploring Lua and learning its intricacies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously improving my Lua skills through personal projects and self-study.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Lua's name means "moon" in Portuguese. It perfectly reflects its elegance and simplicity.

## My Future Projects

I'm excited to embark on my Lua coding journey and work on meaningful projects. Stay tuned for future updates as I share my creations and contributions with the Lua community.

## Contributions

While I haven't made any formal contributions yet, I'm eager to engage with the Lua community and collaborate on exciting projects. If you have any Lua-related initiatives or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Let's learn and grow together!

## Let's Connect

Feel free to connect with me through GitHub and explore my future projects. You can follow me on GitHub to stay updated with my latest work. Let's dive into the amazing Lua ecosystem together.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
